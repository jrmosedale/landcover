S1 simple classification tests

INPUTS
Use Tile E outputs from terrain flatenning and correction - gamma intensities
Choose one ascending and one descending views for each time period:
E. April 17
L. July 17

IMAGE CALC
Calculate VV/VH and VV-VH - choose latter - as intensity and not dimensionless dB
Add RGB VV, VH, VV-VH for each image

Calculate GLCM texture components using VV VH and VV-VH - to give:
contrast, disim, homog, energy, entropy, GLCM mean and variance


ACROSS IMAGE CALC
Create Stack (to allow comparison between images)

Combining ASC and DESC rasters: 
Calculate average VV and VH for April and July

Change detection between times: 
1 RGB as April VH, July VH, July - April VH 
	distinguish between coniferous (blue-yellow) and broadleaf (red) woods
	
2 RGB as April VV-VH,  July VV-VH,  JulyVV-VH - AprilVV-VH 
 	distinguishes between built (yellow) up and forest(red-bl speckle). 
 	Blue fields = 
 	Red fields = 

Next:
Import shape file masks cut to region eg of Forest type, habitat, urban, buildings etc
